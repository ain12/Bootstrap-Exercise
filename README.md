# Bootstrap-Exercise
Create a website where the layout is made with Bootstrap. In this case, I will be using bootstrap 4. The layout is formed by a navbar with the logo image and the links, an two buttons for log in and sign in (a modal appears when you click them). Then, there's a carousel section with pictures. Finally, a footer section to finish the project.
